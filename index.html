    <p id="first-paragraph">My name is <em>Onadeko Oluwateniola</em> and I am a student of Stutern currently enrolled in the <br>
            <b>Software Development track</b>. I have always been fascinated by how people create websites and<br>
         bring ideas to life through writing of codes and it is why I chose to learn front end development.<br>
          <em>Technology as a whole has proved itself countless times to be a good solution to numerous problems<br>
           in the world and I as a web developer in training wish to be part of the numerous developers that <br>
           constantly devote their time to creating soluetions to everyday problems.</em></p>

        <p id="second-paragraph">From the beginning of the stutern course till now, I have learnt so much about <b>HTML/CSS.</b><br>
            I have learnt how to build a solid structure for a website using HTML and I have learnt <br>
            how to add colors and styles to the page using CSS. <em>CSS in one of the most important part of building<br>
            webpages. CSS makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience. Without CSS,<br>
            websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much harder to navigate. In addition to layout and<br>
             format, CSS is responsible for font color and more.</em> </P>
